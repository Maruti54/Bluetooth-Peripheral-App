Bluetooth Protocol - RFCOMM (Serial Port Protocol (HC-05 Adapter))

A flutter App that uses Bluetooth for connection between PC/laptop and the phone. After connecting, input devices like mouse and keyboard can be operated by our phone. It gives the additional feature of a gyroscopic sensor which can transform the mobile phone into a gaming console and enhance gamer experience.

Thank You.
